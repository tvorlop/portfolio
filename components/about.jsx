      <br />
      <p style={{ paddingTop: '1rem' }}>
        I'm Taylor Vorlop, a self-taught frontend developer and founder of Pixel
        Pulse Studios. I build production websites for real clients while
        working full-time in manufacturing.
        <br />
        <br />
        No bootcamp. No CS degree. Just dedication, drive, and a lot of late
        nights learning to code because I genuinely love it.
        <br />
        <br />
        By day, I run CNC machines with 15 years of precision manufacturing
        experience. By night, I'm writing code, building client sites, and
        diving deeper into React.
        <br />
        <br />
        I daily drive Linux (Manjaro with Hyprland window manager), edit in
        Neovim, and spend more time in the terminal than most people spend in a
        browser. This portfolio isn't just a theme, it's how I actually work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently looking for frontend developer opportunities where I can bring
        the same dedication I've put into teaching myself to code.
