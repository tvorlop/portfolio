const aboutText = `I'm Taylor Vorlop, a self-taught frontend developer and
  founder of Pixel Pulse Studios. I build production websites for real clients
  while working full-time in manufacturing.                                   
                                                                              
    No bootcamp. No CS degree. Just dedication, drive, and a lot of late      
  nights learning to code because I genuinely love it.                        
                                                                              
    By day, I run CNC machines with 15 years of precision manufacturing       
  experience. By night, I'm writing code, building client sites, and diving   
  deeper into React.                                                          
                                                                              
    I daily drive Linux (Manjaro with Hyprland window manager), edit in Neovim,
  and spend more time in the terminal than most people spend in a browser.    
  This portfolio isn't just a theme—it's how I actually work.                 
                                                                              
    Currently looking for frontend developer opportunities where I can bring  
  the same dedication I've put into teaching myself to code.`;
